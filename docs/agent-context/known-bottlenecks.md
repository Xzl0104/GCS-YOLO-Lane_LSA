# Known Bottlenecks

This file applies to branch `codex/5-25-3-k56`.

## Branch Scope

The current mainline imports the historical `5-25-3.zip` algorithm and changes only the TuSimple fixed-y contract to Q=12/K=56 with official h-sample anchors.

Do not read mainline Count Head, Count Boundary, Quality Head, Survival Head, near-miss, or official-best bottlenecks as active branch behavior. Those mechanisms are not part of this 5-25-3 branch.

## Data And Geometry

- The active fixed-y anchors must be `710, 700, 690, ..., 160` normalized by original height `720`.
- Do not mix old `fixed_y=[0.98,0.25]` or K32 labels with this branch.
- Do not resample historical K32 labels into K56. Regenerate K56 labels from original TuSimple JSON and images.
- Preserve `--imgsz 544 960` in H,W order.
- The converted fixed-y dataset alone is not the full original TuSimple archive; official TuSimple evaluation still needs original raw-file image resolution/path context.

## Validation

- Local validation can check parser defaults, YAML contracts, fixed-y anchors, model output shape, and sample labels.
- Formal training and official-val evaluation should run on the remote CUDA server.
- This branch includes `tools/eval_tusimple_official.py` and `tools/sweep_tusimple_official.py` for official-val and final TuSimple test evaluation.
- This branch includes `tools/diagnose_tusimple_count_confusion.py` for train/val count-confusion diagnostics by date, GT lane count, and shortest visible-lane bucket.
- It still does not include later mainline `diagnose_gcs_gt5.py`, training-time `official_best` checkpoint preservation, Count/Quality/Boundary diagnostics, Survival, or near-miss machinery.

## Evaluated Candidate Bottleneck

The 2026-06-20 `gcs_yolo_lane_s_tusimple_fixed_y_visible_iou_count03_under5_03` candidate is promotable as the current branch result from official-val selection:

```text
official-val363 ACC = 0.969976
final test ACC = 0.965459
```

The main remaining weakness is lane-count robustness, especially 4-lane scenes. The final test breakdown is diagnostic/reporting-only, not a tuning source:

```text
count_acc_4 = 0.542735
4->3 = 113
4->5 = 96
4->6 = 5
```

Any threshold, max-det, min-points, checkpoint, or postprocess changes must be selected on official-val. Do not tune from the final test breakdown.

## 2026-06-20 Train/Val Count-Confusion Diagnostic

A train/val-only diagnostic was run on the remote server with the frozen `count03_under5_03` checkpoint and the official-val selected decode:

```text
weights = runs/gcs_lane/gcs_yolo_lane_s_tusimple_fixed_y_visible_iou_count03_under5_03/weights/best.pt
decode  = conf=0.05, point_valid_thr=0.5, nms_dist_px=50.0, max_det=8, min_points=5
output  = runs/gcs_lane/gcs_yolo_lane_s_tusimple_fixed_y_visible_iou_count03_under5_03_count_confusion_train_val_by_visibility/summary.json
```

This diagnostic did not sweep test thresholds and is not a candidate promotion. It groups decoded lane-count confusion by split, source date, GT lane count, and shortest visible GT lane bucket.

Fixed-y validation split:

```text
images = 363
count_acc = 0.939394
GT3 count_acc = 0.953271
GT4 count_acc = 0.941667
GT5 count_acc = 0.866667
0601 date count_acc = 0.793103
0313-2|GT4|min_visible<=10: n=6, count_acc=0.166667, confusion 4->3=1, 4->4=1, 4->5=4
0601|GT4|min_visible=11..20: n=6, count_acc=0.333333, confusion 4->3=1, 4->4=2, 4->5=3
0601|GT5|min_visible<=10: n=11, count_acc=0.818182, confusion 5->4=2, 5->5=9
```

Fixed-y training split:

```text
images = 3263
count_acc = 0.963837
GT3 count_acc = 0.974699
GT4 count_acc = 0.959202
GT5 count_acc = 0.968610
0601 date count_acc = 0.905512
0313-2|GT4|min_visible<=10: n=70, count_acc=0.657143, confusion 4->3=7, 4->4=46, 4->5=17
0601|GT4|min_visible<=10: n=19, count_acc=0.368421, confusion 4->3=6, 4->4=7, 4->5=6
0601|GT4|min_visible=11..20: n=47, count_acc=0.680851, confusion 4->3=3, 4->4=32, 4->5=12
0601|GT5|min_visible<=10: n=143, count_acc=0.958042, confusion 5->4=6, 5->5=137
```

Integrated conclusion:

- Supported fact: the count weakness is reproducible on train/val without touching final test. The sharpest train/val failure is `GT4` with short side lanes, especially `0601|GT4|min_visible<=10`.
- Supported fact: `GT5` is comparatively robust on the fixed-y train split, so the next change should not focus only on dense-lane undercount.
- Hypothesis: the current `sum(sigmoid(pred_logits))` count loss plus `target>=5` undercount penalty does not provide enough targeted pressure for `GT4` short-lane undercount and overcount.
- Smallest safe next action: use `tools/diagnose_tusimple_count_confusion.py` for reusable train/val `(date, lane_count, min_visible_points)` confusion, then run a train-only experiment with explicit `--gcs-gt4-short-boost` sampling for `GT4` short-side-lane samples. Selection must remain official-val only.
